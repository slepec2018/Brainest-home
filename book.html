    <p>
        For over thirty years, Drizzt Do'Urden has been one of the most important characters in fantasy literature.
        Throughout his novels, Drizzt has written down his thoughts about life and love, the nature of good and evil,
        the joys (and frustrations) of family, and so much more. Bound together for the first time, the collected wisdom
        and philosophy of Drizzt will be a beautifully-packaged gift book—complete with an introduction by bestselling
        fantasy author Evan Winter—for his biggest fans and readers wanting to learn about this iconic figure.
