        Stefania mum mum Stefania<br>
        The field blooms, but she is turning grey<br>
        Sing me a lullaby mum<br>
        I want to hear your native word<br>
        <br>
        She rocked me; gave me rhythm and probably the power of will; did not take, but she gave<br>
        Probably knew even more and from Solomon<br>
        I will always walk to you by broken roads<br>
        She will not awaken, won’t wake, me in strong storms<br>
        She will take two fig signs from grandma, as if they were bullets<br>
        <br>
        She knew me very well; she was not deceived, like she was very tired; she rocked me in time<br>
        Lyuli lyuli lyuli…<br>
        <br>
        Stefania mum mum Stefania<br>
        The field blooms, but she is turning gray<br>
        Sing me a lullaby mum<br>
        I want to hear your native word<br>
        <br>
        I’m not in diapers but ma but ma, enough, like if<br>
        I did not grow up to grow to pay for things<br>
        I’m not a small child, she still loses her temper,<br>
        I walked, “like the slag would hit you” <br>
        [Ukrainian curse]You are all young oh mother<br>
        at the peak, if I do not value the guardianship <br>
        at the peak of glory I’m in the dead end<br>
        Kill the peak that peak, I would sing with my love<br>
        Lyuli lyuli lyuli…<br>
        <br>
        Stefania mum mum Stefania<br>
        The field blooms, but she is turning gray<br>
        Sing me a lullaby mum<br>
        I want to hear your native word<br>
